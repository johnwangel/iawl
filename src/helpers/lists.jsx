		{ head: 'Perspective', desc: 'We have taken care not to deviate too much from the beloved story. Still, we have developed some of the core elements in ways that we hope will enrich and deepen the experience in ways that resonate with today’s world.' },
		{ head: 'Mary', desc: 'We felt it was important to portray Mary a bit differently. Mary is certainly a strong character in the original film, but in many ways she was never given her due in how she helped George to see himself and be himself. We tried to give Mary a stronger direction as more than just the supportive wife—she is George’s partner.' },
		{ head: 'Bert and Ernie', desc: 'The original film skewed heavily male, from George, Harry, Peter and Billy Bailey, to George’s pals, Bert, Ernie, and Sam. Our decision to cast Bert and Ernie as female was initially a pragmatic concern to balance out the ensemble vocally. However, it also added a new dimension to the story that adds a more modern facet to George’s circle of friends. His acceptance of these two women as part of the gang reflects the evolution of gendered relationships over that past half century. Our decision to include a hint of queerness to these characters reflects inclusion and acceptance of individuals without regard to sexuality.' },
		{ head: 'Martini', desc: ' We were always attracted to the smaller role of Martini, the Italian immigrant who George helps to realize the American dream by moving his family into their own home in Bailey Park. We decided to expand that role, to acknowledge the changing character of the American experience in the acceptance of a diverse array of cultures.' },
		{ head: 'Peter Bailey', desc: 'In the film, Peter Bailey disappears after the first half hour. We wanted to make him more of a presence. Like a Dickens spirit, Peter returns as a reminder of what George at first rebels against, but ultimately of the man he is destined to be.' },
		{ head: 'Diversity', desc: 'And finally, we always felt very strongly that the casting of our show should be completely color blind. The original film came out of an era when cultures and races rarely mixed, and castes were rampant. That is not the reality we would like to reflect in our version. For that reason, we encourage theater companies to embrace a diverse cast that reflects who we are today, not who we were in 1946.' },

		{ head: 'Celebration of Life', desc: 'It’s a Wonderful Life has always taken a dark turn—in line with the A Christmas Carol, the tale that arguably invented the Christmas we know and love today. We have the ghosts, the despair. But more than anything else, we wanted to show the joys of life—the many celebrations of family and friends—that give meaning to our day-to-day existence. The High School Graduation, where the kids dance the Charleston. The opening of Martini&rsquo;s restaurant, where community is embraced. Harry&rsquo;s homecoming as a war hero, in a rousing Andrew’s Sisters–like anthem.  And the Christmas finale that introduces what we hope to be a new Christmas carol standard that celebrates the heart of the Christmas spirit.' },

									<p>The story begins with prayers <span className="song">(Opening Prayers)</span> from George’s friends and family. We first see George in a desperate state and a prayer of his own—for guidance. In a flashback, we see George save his brother Harry when he falls through the ice—and the hint of a parallel event occurring in the present. Watching over this is Clarence, an angel without wings, who is instructed by the big guy, Joseph, to look after George. Clarence is dropped into the idyllic community of Bedford Falls <span className="song">(Bedford Falls)</span>, where its citizens extoll their small-town way of life, or at least the way they believe it “ought to be.” We see Potter breathing down the neck of the Baileys. We meet George and his gang, who recall that day Harry fell through the ice. And Martini, a recent Italian immigrant, arrives in town to a heart-felt welcome. A young George tries to impress Mary and Violet with his big dreams of traveling the world and becoming a hot-shot architect <span className="song">(Think Big)</span>.</p>
									<p>Before George’s graduation, his father Peter presents him with a steamer trunk, but can’t help regretting that George is abandoning the family business, the Bailey Building & Loan. Peter tries to help George understand that it’s more than just a shabby old office <span className="song">(Shabby)</span>. At the graduation dance, George and Mary first see each other through mature eyes. The kids sing a song of subtle rebellion <span className="song">(Doing the Charleston)</span>—after all, this is the first generation that began pushing the boundaries of their parents’ mores, a tradition that has continued ever since. As George and Mary dance together, a jealous Sam and Violet conspire to douse them in the pool beneath the gym floor. Strolling home together in dry rags, George and Mary disagree over the value of the decrepit old Granville house <span className="song">(This Old House)</span>, but a mutual attraction helps them to overcome their differences. </p>
									<p>After Peter passes away, Potter makes a play to shutter the Building & Loan. George is determined to preserve his father’s legacy, making that clear to Potter in no uncertain terms. Potter foresees that George could cause him trouble <span className="song">(Trouble)</span>.</p>
									<p> Harry returns from college with the news that he is marrying and perhaps moving away. Uncle In his own rambling fashion, Billy tries to alleviate the situation, ultimately helping the brothers understand that sometimes love comes first <span className="song">(I Forget)</span>. George visits Mary but finds Sam competing for her affection. George is ready to concede, but Mary urges him to open his eyes to how they have always felt about one another <span className="song">(Open Your Eyes)</span>, leading to their wedding. As George and Mary depart for their honeymoon, they discover a bank run at the Building & Loan <span className="song">(Our Last Dollars)</span>. They quell the crisis by sacrificing their honeymoon kitty to keep the bank open. After a crushing day at the Building & Loan, George receives an invitation to the Granville house, where he is serenaded by Bert and Ernie <span className="song">(Oahu Wahoo)</span> to set the scene for the exotic setup Mary has devised to help disguise the shambling old house—which somehow now feels like a castle <span className="song">(This Old House—Reprise)</span>.</p>
									<p>At the grand opening of his new Italian restaurant, Martini makes George and Mary his guest of honor for their help in making his dream come true. The whole community celebrates in a rousing operatic tarantella <span className="song">(E Mangia)</span>. Potter offers George the world, in exchange for dismantling the Building & Loan. George is nearly seduced <span className="song">(You’re Hired)</span>. After giving up what is probably his last chance at fulfilling his big dreams, George sinks into despondence. He sees in himself the reflection of his father <span className="song">(Act 1 Finale)</span>.</p>

									<p>In anticipation of Harry’s triumphant return as a wartime hero, Uncle Billy taunts Potter with the Bailey resilience, assisted by four women and a Big Band anthem <span className="song">(You Can’t Keep the Bailey Boys Down)</span>. In the excitement, Billy loses his $8,000 bank deposit. After learning of the missing deposit, George returns home. In his state, the daily routines are niggling reminders of his failures. But when he looks in on his ailing daughter Zuzu, he is reminded of the family bonds that have kept him going <span className="song">(Your White Knight)</span>. After another series of setbacks from Potter and then the enraged husband of Zuzu’s teacher, George contemplates drowning himself in the frozen lake. Clarence intervenes by jumping in himself so that George would save him. He introduces himself as a guardian angel, to a skeptical George <span className="song">(“An Angel Gets His Wings”)</span>.</p>
									<p>In a last-ditch effort to convince George of his own worth, Clarence arranges to show a world in which George was never born <span className="song">(Pottersville)</span>. Slowly George begins to realize the disastrous impact his absence has had on all of his friends and family. The ghosts of his past bombard him with reminders of what was lost, until he is drowned in the void of his non-existence.</p>
									<p>Begging for another chance, George finds himself back home, with Potter the sheriff at his doorstep. Reborn and unfazed, George rushes to embrace his children. Mary returns, accompanied by the entire community, there to help George out. Thwarted, Potter storms away, as friends and family sing of the transformative power of the Christmas spirit <span className="song">(Christmas Day)</span>. A newly fledged Clarence appears, watching over them. </p>
