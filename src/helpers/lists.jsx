		{ head: 'Perspective', desc: 'We have taken care not to deviate too much from the beloved story. Still, we have developed some of the core elements in ways that we hope will enrich and deepen the experience in ways that resonate with today’s world.' },
		{ head: 'Mary', desc: 'We felt it was important to portray Mary a bit differently. Mary is certainly a strong character in the original film, but in many ways she was never given her due in how she helped George to see himself and be himself. We tried to give Mary a stronger direction as more than just the supportive wife—she is George’s partner.' },
		{ head: 'Bert and Ernie', desc: 'The original film skewed heavily male, from George, Harry, Peter and Billy Bailey, to George’s pals, Bert, Ernie, and Sam. Our decision to cast Bert and Ernie as female was initially a pragmatic concern to balance out the ensemble vocally. However, it also added a new dimension to the story that adds a more modern facet to George’s circle of friends. His acceptance of these two women as part of the gang reflects the evolution of gendered relationships over that past half century. Our decision to include a hint of queerness to these characters reflects inclusion and acceptance of individuals without regard to sexuality.' },
		{ head: 'Martini', desc: ' We were always attracted to the smaller role of Martini, the Italian immigrant who George helps to realize the American dream by moving his family into their own home in Bailey Park. We decided to expand that role, to acknowledge the changing character of the American experience in the acceptance of a diverse array of cultures.' },
		{ head: 'Peter Bailey', desc: 'In the film, Peter Bailey disappears after the first half hour. We wanted to make him more of a presence. Like a Dickens spirit, Peter returns as a reminder of what George at first rebels against, but ultimately of the man he is destined to be.' },
		{ head: 'Diversity', desc: 'And finally, we always felt very strongly that the casting of our show should be completely color blind. The original film came out of an era when cultures and races rarely mixed, and castes were rampant. That is not the reality we would like to reflect in our version. For that reason, we encourage theater companies to embrace a diverse cast that reflects who we are today, not who we were in 1946.' },

		{ head: 'Clarence', desc: 'And we have been overjoyed at the audience reaction when we actually see Clarence get his wings. The audience is left with a high that enhances the joyous holiday season.' },
		{ head: 'Celebration of Life', desc: 'It’s a Wonderful Life has always taken a dark turn—in line with the A Christmas Carol, the tale that arguably invented the Christmas we know and love today. We have the ghosts, the despair. But more than anything else, we wanted to show the joys of life—the many celebrations of family and friends—that give meaning to our day-to-day existence. The High School Graduation, where the kids dance the Charleston. The opening of Martini&rsquo;s restaurant, where community is embraced. Harry&rsquo;s homecoming as a war hero, in a rousing Andrew’s Sisters–like anthem.  And the Christmas finale that introduces what we hope to be a new Christmas carol standard that celebrates the heart of the Christmas spirit.' },
		{ head: 'Pottersville', desc: 'We have re-imagined the entire Pottersville sequence, in which George slowly descends into the darkness of the new reality of his non-existence. The audience experiences the despair in a visceral way that can only come in a musical.' },
